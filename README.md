# Who am I ?

My name is Cameron Peterson, I grew up in Alaska, and have lived there for over 20 years. My hobbies include software development(coding), video games, fishing, and woodworking.

I have worked on multiple self-guided projects. Two of them were requested by Ptarmigan Pediatrics, the first being [Camvax](https://github.com/IDzyre/camvax), a self-hosted vaccine inventory and tracking web-app, built to try to reduce wasted vaccines, and keep track of inventory. This reduced undue waste from an average of 10 vaccines per month, to less than 1  per month.

The second is [Ptimecard](https://github.com/IDzyre/Ptimecard), a timecard system that allows for requesting time off, and tracking it VIA a calendar. 

My most recent "self-guided" project is [DzyreRecipes](https://github.com/IDzyre/DzyreRecipes), a self-hosted API based recipe keeper. It is currently in the works, but eventually will have a web-app, and a mobile app.

I have was a Google Summer of Code(GSOC) contributor on [Submitty](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty) in the summer of 2023, and stayed on as a mentor, and maintainer. I have worked as a GSOC mentor every time Submitty has gotten accepted since then.

I worked as the Student Systems Administrator for the Computer Science Department of Walla Walla University from December 2022 to June 2024, and from August 2025- June 2026, with a gap year for studying abroad. My main job was creating, and maintaining servers hosted on Proxmox using ansible scripts. I managed the servers used by computer science classes, and most of the math classes.
